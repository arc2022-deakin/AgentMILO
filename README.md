# AgentMILO: A Knowledge-Based Conversational Agent for MILP Modeling

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)  
AgentMILO is an **LLM-powered conversational agent** designed to assist non-expert users in **modeling Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems**. By integrating **expert-designed knowledge graphs**, AgentMILO helps users define constraints, variables, and objectives, ultimately generating structured **MILP formulations**.

This repository includes:
- **Source Code** for developing and running AgentMILO.
- **Prompts** optimized for MILP modeling.
- **Expert-designed Knowledge Graphs** for Production Planning (PP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variations.
- **Tested Problem Instances** for benchmarking AgentMILO.
- **Generated Conversations & Results** comparing AgentMILO with a general LLM agent.
- **Complete Experimental Setup** for reproducibility.
