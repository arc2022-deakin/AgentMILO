# 📦 AgentMILO: A Knowledge-Based Conversational Agent for MILP Modeling

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)  
AgentMILO is an LLM-powered conversational agent designed to assist non-expert users in modeling Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems. By integrating expert-designed knowledge graphs, AgentMILO helps users define constraints, variables, and objectives, ultimately generating structured MILP formulations.

This repository includes:
- Source Code for developing and running AgentMILO.
- Prompts optimized for MILP modeling.
- Expert-designed Knowledge Graphs for Production Planning (PP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variations.
- Tested Problem Instances for benchmarking AgentMILO.
- Generated Conversations & Results comparing AgentMILO with a general LLM agent.
- Complete Experimental Setup for reproducibility.

## 📌 Features
✔ Conversational MILP Modeling – Guides users through problem specification.  
✔ Knowledge Graph Integration – Uses structured knowledge for question generation.  
✔ Support for PP & TSP Variations – Pre-built optimization domains.  
✔ AutoGen-based LLM Agent – Utilizes GPT-4o for dynamic conversations.  
✔ Reproducible Experiments – Includes problem instances, model outputs, and evaluation results.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 📂 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arc2022-deakin/AgentMILO.git
cd AgentMILO
```
### 📥 Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run AgentMILO
Since all the code is inside a .ipynb launch Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab open the notebook:
```bash
notebook AgentMILO.ipynb
```
Then, run the notebook cell by cell to interact with AgentMILO.

## 🏆 Experiments & Findings

AgentMILO was evaluated against a general LLM agent using:
- 10 distinct user profiles
- PP & TSP problem instances
- Key metrics: clarity, question quality, model accuracy, and ease of interaction
